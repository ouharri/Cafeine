### Why should you have a multilingual website?

It’s easy to forget all about other languages when setting up your online business! With the resources needed to put together a new website, multilingual capabilities are very commonly ignored, as the process to get multiple translations can get complicated and expensive. But ignoring the importance of being multilingual can be a costly mistake: unlocking the possibility for visitors to read and interact in their own language means you’ll be significantly widening your reach, increasing your chances of business success!

This is why it’s important to think of ways to cater for more languages: multilingual websites naturally rank in more countries and attract more potential customers. Your visitors will also feel like you are significantly more localized by speaking to them in a language they easily understand!

But how about the cost and headache to set up a proper multilingual website? This is where Weglot can make it easy: with a simple way to unlock multilingual capabilities swiftly, your website can go from targeted towards a single language to multilingual in an easy, affordable manner!

= Can I use subdomains for each language? =
It's not currently possible to use several subdomains on WordPress with Weglot Translate such as de.website.com. However, Weglot uses subdirectories in your URL to separate all the multilingual versions of your website.

For example, if your website is website.com, then the French version would be website.com/fr/, same for the German version website.com/de/, and so on. This is repeated for each version of your new multilingual website. A unique URL is therefore created for each version of your multilingual web page, which is important for your SEO.
