By using our drag & drop editor, you can easily customize the look and feel of your campaigns, and even add dynamic elements like countdown timers, spin a wheel, etc that change based on user behavior (no code necessary).

But don't just take our word. See what Joost De Valk from Yoast SEO is saying:

> Joost de Valk, Founder of Yoast SEO (<a href="https://optinmonster.com/case-study-how-yoast-doubled-his-email-signups-and-added-10000-email-subscribers-in-a-month/?utm_source=orgplugin&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=wpreadme" rel="friend">See Case Study</a>)

=== Pre-built Popup Templates using our Popup Builder ===

OptinMonster comes with hundreds of popup templates to help you save time. See our <a href="https://optinmonster.com/exit-intent-popup-examples/?utm_source=orgplugin&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=wpreadme" rel="friend">exit popup template gallery</a>.

=== Exit Intent Popups and OnSite Retargeting ===

Did you know that over 70% of visitors abandoning your website will never return?

OptinMonster's signature <a href="https://optinmonster.com/features/exit-intent/?utm_source=orgplugin&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=wpreadme" rel="friend">exit-intent popup technology</a> can help you convert abandoning visitors into subscribers and customers.

With exit intent popups, your visitors see a targeted popup message at the precise moment they are about to leave.

Exit popups are proven to convert an additional 2 - 4% of your visitors into email subscribers and paying customers.

You can use exit intent popups combined with <a href="https://optinmonster.com/features/onsite-retargeting/?utm_source=orgplugin&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=wpreadme" rel="friend">OnSite retargeting</a> to show different popup messages to new visitors vs returning visitors. The exit-intent trigger is just one of many triggers available in our popup maker.

These advanced popup triggers are highly effective in growing your email list, reducing WooCommerce cart abandonment, and saving you moeny on PPC advertising and retargeting ads.

> In only 7 months, we added more than 95,000 names to our email list using OptinMonster's Exit Intent™ technology. We strongly recommend it!<br>
> Michael Stelzner, Founder of Social Media Examiner (<a href="https://optinmonster.com/how-social-media-examiner-250000-subscribers-using-optinmonster-split-testing/?utm_source=orgplugin&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=wpreadme" rel="friend">See Case Study</a>)

=== Smart Page Targeting and Behavior Based Personalization ===

All OptinMonster popups comes with advanced page targeting and behavior based personalization.

This means you can show a custom popup for specific page or section of your site, show a custom popup based on users' geolocation, show a custom popup when users click a specific link, and more.

You can even show unique popups based on user's past behavior such as: have they clicked on an existing marketing popup, seen another popup campaign, closed a marketing popup, viewed X number of pages, etc.

These personalization features of OptinMonster popups make them highly effective in improving your lead generation, increasing subscribers, and growing sales.

> Using OptinMonster, I was able to increase sales $55,000 after capturing nearly 7% more leads with a single optin!<br>
> Cole Joseph, Owner of Cole's Classroom (<a href="https://optinmonster.com/coles-classroom-added-55494-sales?utm_source=orgplugin&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=wpreadme" rel="friend">See Case Study</a>)


=== Popup A/B Testing, Email Marketing Integrations, and Popup Analytics ===

Unlike other WordPress lead generation plugins, OptinMonster comes with reliable A/B split testing and accurate analytics without slowing down your site.

Most of them use wp-ajax to setup nalytics. This slows down your site and also results in unreliable analytics due to cache plugin settings.

Similarly, A/B testing in a most WordPress popup plugins is broken because caching plugins can skew the data.

We fixed both these issues with our superior infrastructure, so you can have reliable A/B testing for popups, accurate conversion analytics, and seamless email marketing / CRM integrations for your marketing (bonus: lead storage & lead backup are now included, too).

> Since we started using OptinMonster our email list conversion rate increased by 300% and our sales by 20%. The best investment you can make for your online business!<br>
